# Introduce the web application 

The choice of the web application to create on cloud Azure and AWS would depend on several factors such as your skills, experience, and the purpose of the application you want to create. However, We decied to create E-commerce web application.

## E-commerce web application: 

If you want to create an e-commerce web application, you could consider using a platform like Magento, Shopify or WooCommerce, and deploy it on a cloud service. These platforms have built-in support for e-commerce features like shopping carts, payment gateways, and inventory management.

## Django

I have chosen to develop my e-commerce website using Django because of its powerful and flexible framework that enables rapid development and scalability. Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and is based on the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. This allows for efficient development of web applications, as code is written once and reused wherever possible. Django's built-in features such as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), a templating engine, and an authentication system, along with a large library of third-party packages, make it an ideal choice for building complex web applications such as e-commerce platforms.

One of the key benefits of using Django for an e-commerce website is its ability to handle large amounts of data and transactions. Django's ORM layer provides an easy way to interact with a database and manage data related to products, orders, customers, and more. Additionally, Django provides tools for handling user input securely, which is essential for online transactions.

Finally, I plan to host my website on a cloud platform, which will provide scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Cloud platforms offer the ability to easily scale resources up or down based on traffic demand, ensuring that my website can handle a large number of users without any performance issues. Cloud platforms also offer high availability and reliability by replicating data across multiple servers and data centers, ensuring that my website is always available and performing well. Additionally, cloud platforms provide several security features such as firewalls, identity and access management, and encryption, which can help protect my website and user data from cyber attacks. Overall, using Django and hosting on a cloud platform provides the necessary features and benefits to build and run a successful e-commerce website.
