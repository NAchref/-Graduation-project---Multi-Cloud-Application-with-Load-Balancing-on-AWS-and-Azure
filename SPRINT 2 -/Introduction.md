## AWS Deployement :

### Create EC2 instance & configuration : 

To create an EC2 instance on AWS, several essential steps need to be followed to ensure a successful setup. 
The procss involes using the AWS management Console. Firstly, i log in to the AWS Management Console with my credentials. Then, navigate to the EC2
Dashbord and select the "Launch Instance" (Lancer instance) option. Next, I choose the desired Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in my case i choose Ubnunto
and i configure to create a Security Group and also checked to allow SSH traffic from. Finally check all your configuration and press Launch instance. So i get a pop up to create key pair or not or to processed without key pair ( key pair allows you to connect to your instance securely), For me i choose to move for processed without key pair.
