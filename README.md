# -Graduation-project---Multi-Cloud-Application-with-Load-Balancing-on-AWS-and-Azure
The purpose of this graduation project is to develop and deploy a multi-cloud application on both AWS and Azure platforms, and to implement a load balancing mechanism between the two platforms to optimize the application's performance and availability.

Our project is a cloud application framework that provides intra- and inter-cloud resilience to reduce vendor disruptions. Much research has been done on intra-loud resilience, which allows applications to move from one server to another. However, intra-loud reliability platforms are not as common.
