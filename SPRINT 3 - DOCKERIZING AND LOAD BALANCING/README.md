## Dockerizing

Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers.

`Docker` is an open source tool that ships your application with all the necessary functionalities as one package.

You can use Docker to pack your application with everything you need to run the application (such as libraries) and ship it as one package - a container. Containers are created from images that specify their precise contents. 

Dockerizing is a big hit nowadays. All the big names use it - Google, VMware, or Amazon support it.

* There are two parts of Docker:

The `Docker Engine` - a portable packaging tool
The `Docker Hub` - cloud service for sharing applications
